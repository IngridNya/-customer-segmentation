This project explores how to segment customers into distinct groups using K-Means clustering. It helps businesses better understand their customer base and make data-driven decisions.

## 🔍 What I Did
- Cleaned and explored the data
- Performed **Feature Engineering**: created a **loyalty score** and added **age categories** as new features
- Applied K-Means clustering
- Used the Elbow Method to find the optimal number of clusters
- Interpreted and visualized the results in a Jupyter Notebook and powerpoint

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- Python (Pandas, Seaborn, Scikit-learn)
- Jupyter Notebook
- powerpoint
